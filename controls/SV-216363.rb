immediate physical vicinity of the system but does not want to log out because of the temporary 
nature of the absence. 

Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before the 
user session can be locked, the operating system needs to provide users with the ability to 
manually invoke a session lock so users may secure their account should the need arise for them 
to temporarily vacate the immediate physical vicinity."

For Solaris 11.4 or newer:
In

locks and displays the \"password\" prompt.

Check that \"Disable Screensaver\" is not
